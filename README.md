## End-to-End Application for LangChain Basics

This notebook demonstrates the fundamental concepts and usage of LangChain, covering prompt templates, large language models (LLMs), and output parsers. By following the steps in this notebook, you will learn how to create modular AI-driven workflows using LangChain.

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. **LLMs as Chat Models**: Learn how to interact with LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) using LangChain's `ChatOpenAI` to generate AI-driven conversations.
2. **Prompt Templates**: Structure prompts with system and human messages, making it easy to design AI conversations that are reusable and dynamic.
3. **Output Parsers**: Customize how AI responses are processed and formatted by using output parsers. For example, transform comma-separated text into structured lists.
4. **Streamlit Q&A App**: A basic app that allows users to input questions and receive responses from the AI using LangChain.

### How to Run the Notebook:
To ensure everything works as expected, you may need to upgrade some packages, especially `langchain-openai`. Run the following command if you encounter issues:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-openai
